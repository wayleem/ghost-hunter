# Ghost Hunter
A mobile photography game for a Stony Brook related course. Project outline is to rapidly prototype a mobile app. The premise of the game is to use the camera function is capture ghosts in your environment. The app attempts to emulate "ghost hunting" with a crude EMF reader on the UI. This simple prototytpe's lifespan to playtest presentation was about 2-3 weeks. 

## Preview
Here are some gifs demonstrating the game's functionality.

### Capturing ghosts
A light indicator on the left alerts you whether a ghost is present in the room or not. A red blinker indicates that when you take a photo, a ghost will appear on your picture. When taking a picture with no ghost activity, the app will prompt you to retake a picture.

This shows that no ghosts are present as indicated by the reader.

# Deploying
Download Expo Go on your mobile device to provide a server to host the app. Be sure to enable camera permissions on the Expo Go app.

## Building & Testing
1. run `npm i` in the terminal of the working directory.
2. run `npm run start` in order to obtain a qr code.
3. scanning the qr code with your mobile device will prompt to open the Expo Go app.
4. open the app in Expo Go.
<br/> if the app __doesn't load__, try reloading by pressing `r` on your terminal.
